Migrating from [DatePicker](#datetime/datepicker)?

</h5>

DatePicker2 is a replacement for DatePicker and will replace it in Blueprint v6.
You are encouraged to use this new API now to ease the transition to the next major version of Blueprint.
See the [react-day-picker v8 migration guide](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/react-day-picker-8-migration)
on the wiki.

</div>

__DatePicker2__ has the same functionality as [DatePicker](#datetime/datepicker) but uses
[react-day-picker v8](https://react-day-picker.js.org/) instead of [v7](https://react-day-picker-v7.netlify.app/)
to render its calendar.
